# Reven

Another Discord RPC client, cuz why not?

You can download the app from [releases](https://github.com/Zeroo28/discord_rpc/releases/) or [build](#getting-started) your client by following the steps below.


## Getting started

Make sure you have all the requirements installed on your machine before proceeding.


**Requirements**: [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and Git.


For flutter-related questions/doubts, refer to their [documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/).

Then, clone the repository and install all dependencies.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Zeroo28/discord_rpc
cd discord_rpc
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

\*_Flutter only supports building an application for your platform._
